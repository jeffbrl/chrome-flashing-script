I modified John Lewis's script for flashing Intel-based Chromebooks after I noticed his site was down. All credit
goes to firm for the original flash_cb_fw.sh script.

What I did was replace https://johnlewis.ie URLs with Wayback Machine URLs. I removed the md5 check on the
downloaded files as the MD5 checksums file seems to have been archived on a different date, a circumstance that
breaks the MD5 check. Note that this is very dangerous. Proceed at your own risk.

I believe this script will work as long as the Internet Archive remains up. I tested the script on my ASUS
C720.
